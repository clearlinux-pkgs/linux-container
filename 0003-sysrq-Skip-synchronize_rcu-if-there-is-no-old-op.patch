Subject: [PATCH 03/13] sysrq: Skip synchronize_rcu() if there is no old op

synchronize_rcu() is expensive. Currently it is called as part of the sysrq
registration/unregistration, which happens during boot several times.
Now, the reason for the synchronize_rcu() is to allow an old registered
operation to expire properly... which is pointless if the old operation
is NULL...
So we can save the common case of the old operation being NULL a lot of time
by just checking for non-NULL prior to the synchronize_rcu()
